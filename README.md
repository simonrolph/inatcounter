# iNaturalist Live
Live visualisation of iNaturalist observations and identifications.

## About

This is a one-page serverless web page that calls the iNaturalist API: https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/docs/ to show actions across the whole of iNaturalist such as submission of records and identification of records.

It has three main features:
 * A central counter for the number of verifable records in iNaturalist
 * A map with markers for new submissions or identification on iNatauralist. Markers have a popup with a small image of the observation, and the current identification. THe symbol of the marker indicates whether it is an observation or a identification, and the type of identification, as idicated by the key on the bottom of the page.
 * A 'ticker' on the right hand side which lists new observations / identifications as they are added to iNaturalist. Mouse rollover highlights the corresponding marker on the map. Clicking on the ticker item takes you to inaturalist to look at the observation on iNaturalist.org.
